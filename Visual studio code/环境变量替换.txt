Variable substitution
VS Code supports variable substitution inside strings in launch.json and has the following predefined variables:

${workspaceFolder} - the path of the folder opened in VS Code
${workspaceRootFolderName} - the name of the folder opened in VS Code without any slashes (/)
${file} - the current opened file
${relativeFile} - the current opened file relative to workspaceRoot
${fileBasename} - the current opened file's basename
${fileBasenameNoExtension} - the current opened file's basename with no file extension
${fileDirname} - the current opened file's dirname
${fileExtname} - the current opened file's extension
${cwd} - the task runner's current working directory on startup
${lineNumber} - the current selected line number in the active file
You can also reference environment variables through ${env:Name} syntax (for example, ${env:PATH}). Be sure to match the environment variable name's casing, for example ${env:Path} on Windows.
